TOPCON RE200
Black Body
TOPCON RE200
Black Finished

　Originally, only the chrome body was sold in Japan, but when the RE300 was later released with a black body, it seems that the RE200 was also sold in a black body in Japan. Overseas, both black and white versions were listed in catalogs from an early stage, but in Japan, as far as I know, the product was introduced at the Japan Camera Show in 1978. However, strangely enough, the product introduction in the 1981 camera yearbook listed "chrome bodies only," and in fact, it seems that almost no black bodies were distributed in Japan.
　The standard lens is the RE Topkor N 55mm F1.7, which is also a new design that simplifies assembly. The interchangeable lenses, from 28mm to 200mm, were redesigned and called the "N series," but the lenses do not have the "N" mark.
This is the diffusion model that used the RE mount of launched in 1977. And it is simple make, because it is made a low price to the motto. Therefore, This camera is light and compact and simple, so the user-friendliness is not bad.

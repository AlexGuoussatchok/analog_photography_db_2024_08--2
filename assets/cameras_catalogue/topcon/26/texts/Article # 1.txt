TOPCON RE200
TOPCON RE200

　A popular model released in 1977 that uses the RE mount (Topcon's first mount since the RE Super, which added various mechanisms to the EX mount). It has a mediocre TTL system that uses CdS for the photodetector, which is a step backwards from the times. However, since it is made with the motto of low price, I wonder if this is a Topcon product? It's so simple and low-cost that you'd doubt it. A time-consuming mirror meter is not used, and the CdS is placed next to the viewfinder eyepiece window, just like in a regular camera. However, while the IC-1 had one placed on each side, this one has been thoroughly simplified, with only one placed above. Exposure is checked using three LED lamps instead of a needle. When the green lamp in the center lights up, the exposure is correct, but it actually seems to be displayed with quite a bit of leeway, and the correct exposure range is so wide that it seems like there is one stop. Although the shutter uses a copal square shutter, the AE mechanism that was installed in the IC-1, which had a horizontal cloth curtain shutter, has also been abolished.
　The warship section is made of plastic, and each part looks like a toy. In particular, although the battery compartment cover can now be opened and closed with a single touch, it is not locked separately, so there is a risk that it will open at the slightest thing. Once I put the self-timer down, it becomes unsteady and I can put it back up with my finger (the timer itself is effective). As you can see, it is quite cheaply made, but on the other hand, it is also lightweight and compact, and combined with its simplicity, it is not bad to use.

The grey finish Leica IIIc and Leica IIIcK, made in approximately 3,400 examples between 1942 and 1945 (serial №s 387 201 -387 300, 387 501 - 390525. 391 026 - 391 039, and 391 424 -391 699), are particularly fascinating, possibly because their history is connected to the dramatic events of world war II. In more recent times, at least one grey finish Leica М3 was made in 1954 (serial n° 700 066) and 20 grey Leica M2s (serial n°s 1 005 751 - 1 005 770).

Very little is known of the grey Leica М3, so much so that many a Leica “expert” even doubted its existence. The grey М3 is different from its “sister” cameras in that the metal parts are finished in silver-chrome. Therefore it’s only the vulkanite, the opening camera back and its stays are finished in grey.

The grey М3 mirrors the specification of the very first series production Leica М3 cameras. The top plate specifically displays its characteristic step. The grey М3 is however a little different from its contemporaries in that it has an external pre-selector of the viewfinder frame, possibly applied at a later stage as is traditional when Leitz-Leica cameras are serviced by the factory. The grey Leica М3 is supplied with a prototype retractable Summicron 5cm f/2 with two focusing knobs (serial n° 920 084). At least another example - serial n° 1 480 824 - of this lens is known. Finally, it is worth noting that the Leica М3 in its classy grey livery, much more intriguing and elegant than the standard black, was made as a test model to probe the market’s reactions.

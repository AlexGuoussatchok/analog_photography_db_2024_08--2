Canonflex R 2000

During 1960, the original Canonflex, also improperly known as the Canonflex R or Canonflex R 1000 was replaced by an outwardly identical model of slightly improved performance called the Canonflex R 2000.

The Canonflex R 2000 also had a removable viewfinder with a black finished pentaprism and base plate mounted film advance lever, but has the honour of being the first SLR equipped with a l/2000s shutter. This implied using a modified coupled light meter to take into account the new speed scale. In spite of the record shutter speed, not even the Canonflex R 2000 was a success in the international markets, particularly the US professional market, which was monopolised by the Nikon F, a contemporary of the original Canonflex. The Canonflex R 2000 was made for little over 18 months, from June 1960 to January 1962, but production was little more than 9,000 units.

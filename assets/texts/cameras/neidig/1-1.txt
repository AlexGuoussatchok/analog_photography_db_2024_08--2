Neidig

Neidig Kamerawerk was based in Plankstadt and made cameras from 1949 till about 1953. This was the Perlux range with quite a distinct body design. The first model had a fixed lens, later ones had interchangeable lenses based on the Paxette m39 mount. The cameras were also sold as DeJUR and Bower in the USA.

Neidig Perlux
The first Perlux reached the market in 1949 and was a fairly simple viewfinder camera with wind knob and body-mounted shutter release. It had the name Perlux on the shutter plate as well as on its back. It was available with a range of fixed lenses, but most commonly a Staeble Kataplast or Steinheil Cassar in Prontor-S shutter. Identical versions were sold as Bower 35 and Adox 35, with the name printed on the shutter plate. It had a small pin next to the wind knob that indicated if the shutter lock was released and the camera ready to shoot.

Perlux rebranded as Adox 35. I am a little surprised that Adox rebranded this model, as they generally build their own cameras, whereas most rebranded cameras were distributed by photography retailers.

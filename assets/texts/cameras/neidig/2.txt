Neidig Perlux Ia
The Perlux Ia had lever wind, a new larger top housing and an interchangeable lens mount, the same m39 screw mount as Paxette cameras. It could thus use all lenses that were available for the Paxette range. Note that none of the Perlux models has their model number on the camera, which often leads to them being referred to by the wrong number (this one was sold as a Perlux II). The wind lever needed two strokes to cock the shutter and transport the film. It would rather unusually spring back all the way over the top of the camera.

Perlux Ia with Staeble-Kata 45mm f/2.8 lens, which appears to be the standard lens this camera was sold with. Note the peculiar wind lever.

Four years after the Halina 35X, came the 35X Super, offering little over the earlier model. The body is similar, with the top cover on steroids. On the 35X, it was a flat, low profile base with a bulge housing the viewer, trigger and shoe; here, the whole top cover is elevated. The most pronounced improvement is the viewer, which is large and bright compared to the tiny keyhole of the earlier model. A top-mounted cocking lever that winds and cocks the shutter replaced the winding knob, and the lens-mounted cocking lever has gone. The frame counter is within the cocking lever base.

The shutter is a three-leaf, with the same speeds as before. The lens assembly is the same as the earlier model but a much larger barrel. Perhaps here is the additional 100gr buried. The protruding lock at the base is carried over, making the camera unstable just as the earlier model.

Finishes here are the same as at the 35X, with a comforting factor, the name embossing on top and front look decent, not as if made by an apprentice. An odd upgrade, where the earlier model states’ Made in Hong Kong’, here it is upgraded to “Epmire made’, for whatever it means.

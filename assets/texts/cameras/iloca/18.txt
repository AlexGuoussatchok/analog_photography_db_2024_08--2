Iloca Rapid A1
The Rapid A1 is a slightly upgraded version of the original Iloca Rapid (or Rapid A as it was sometimes known).  This camera has essentially the same specification as the original version, but in a newer body housing.  The main improvement is the larger viewfinder which is centrally mounted on this model.  Gone is the left hand rapid film advance lever, replaced by a more conventional right-hand operated lever.  

This model is devoid of such extras as a rangefinder, exposure meter, and in the case of the Vero shutter (which has only four speeds from 1/25 to 1/200 sec plus B), no delayed action (self timer) setting or flash settings are provided.  However it does have a PC flash contact.  The Steinheil 45mm Cassar F2.8 lens is quite good quality, and delivers more than satisfactory results in most cases - not pin-sharp but not bad either, and it seems to render colours quite well.

So for someone after no-frills photography in a relatively compact, well-built body, this model would have served them quite well.

One tip for opening the back on these cameras - pull the rewind knob upwards to its full extension. Then twist slowly clockwise and the springloaded mechanism should release the back. The back on these models is not symmetrical and only fits one way.
In Summary
A neat, compact, no-frills 35mm camera.  Robust and well-built, there is not much that can go wrong.  The camera is capable of producing quite good results under the right conditions.

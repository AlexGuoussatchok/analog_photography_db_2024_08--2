TOPCON IC- 1 AUTO Black

finished

　Naturally, a black body was also available for the IC-1. The price is +2,000 yen, and if you include the 3,000 yen charge for the case, it will be 51,500 yen.It was a TTL-EE camera in 1974 that was in the same price range as the Petri FTE, and strangely the upper limit of the shutter was 1/500 seconds. The same goes for the shutter-priority auto mode.
　The synchronization contact is now only X, but the shoe on the prism cover is not yet a hot shoe, which leaves something to be desired.
　The aperture setting dial is engraved with "2 2.8 / 4 5.6" and corresponds to the UV mount top call, but it corresponds to the HI zoom top call 87-205mm F4.7, and it has 4 and 5.6. A click is provided in between. Note that "." is for UV Topcor 35mm F3.5, and there is also a click between 2 and 2.8.

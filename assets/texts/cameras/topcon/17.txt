Beseler TOPCONETTE

　This is the export version of Wink Mirror E to the United States, a model called Topconet released by Becerra. Functionally, there is no particular difference from Wink Mirror E, only the nameplate is different. Although the camera has a charming name, the number of units produced is very small, and it is a model that rarely appears on the second-hand market.
　As it is a model with a quick return mechanism that is complicated and troublesome for a lens-shutter type SLR, it is very common for the oil around the lens shutter and aperture to become stuck due to aging, and the entire unit becomes immobile due to a malfunction in one part. Since the number of units produced is low to begin with, and the survival rate drops sharply due to such failures, it is thought that the chances of seeing them will decrease even more in the future.
These cameras are the upgrading version of the selenium light photometer inclusion of launched in 1961. It is not "EE" yet. And the lens mount is fixed. The focus combines by the lever on the right side of the lens. From these models, the standard lens became "UV TOPCOR".

PR 2nd
model

　This is a later model with minor changes, and the first thing you'll notice is that the lens barrel is now black. A small plastic thing is used for the self-timer's finger hook, but the shutter unit is Citizen MV and is the same as the earlier model.
　The silver vapor deposition on the pentaprism used in the first PR was weak and seemed to cause problems with peeling off easily, so from later models onwards a more reliable version was used.
　The fixed lens is a Topcor 5cm F2.8 Tessar type with 4 elements in 3 groups. TOPCOR AUX. WIDE-ANGLE LENS 3.7cm F4 and TELEPHOTO LENS 9.4cm F4 are available as conversion lenses.
　Other than that, the overall design of both is simple, small, light, and cute.
It is the substantial leaf shutter single-lens reflex camera of the prism installation at the first Japan that was launched in 1959. The lens is Topcor 5cm f2.8. It is the Tesser style of constitution 3 groups 4 elements. Although the mirror is not a quick return and even the aperture is a manual operation presetting ceremony, it is small light, and it is completed lovelylily. The measure and weight are 130×82×71mm and 620 g.

TOPCON UNIREX
TOPCON UNIREX

　Announced in 1969, it was virtually the last lens-shutter SLR. It was produced until around 1973, and was the last domestically produced LS-SLR aircraft, along with the Kowa SET-R2.
　The standard lens is UV Topcor 50mm F2. It has a beautiful design with a white barrel. The basic structure of this lens is actually the same as the previous UV Topcor 53mm F2. However, the finish of the lens barrel has improved considerably, giving it a sense of luxury that had not been felt before (though the extensive use of red in the text on the lens barrel has spoiled this to some extent). .
　In the case of Unirex's chrome body, we are particular about the chrome finish, even down to the hood. The appearance of Unirex with this installed is so beautiful that it is hard to believe that it is a popular machine. The lens is mounted by screwing into the front of the helicoid ring rather than the tip of the lens barrel, creating a perfect sense of unity between the lens and hood.
　The biggest feature of this camera is, without a doubt, the mechanism that allows the TTL metering method to be switched between spot and average. Switch the lever attached to the base of the rewind crank to the S/A position. Spot metering for the S mark is done using a traditional mirror meter, while average metering for the A mark is done using a CdS placed behind a prism, similar to a typical TTL camera. Around this time, Mamiya and Ricoh had models with similar mechanisms, but none of them were AE machines. Another crucial difference is that they were focal plane planes. In fact, during production, there were some people within the company who objected to such excessive specifications, despite the fact that it was an entry-level lens-shutter camera that was complex and difficult to produce, yet had to be inexpensive. , I can really feel Topcon's enthusiasm in what they've built up to this point.

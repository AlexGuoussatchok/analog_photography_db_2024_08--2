TOPCON RM300
TOPCON RM300

　It is known to those in the know as Topcon's last 35mm single-lens reflex camera, and it is thought to have been released in 1978, but it was discontinued without being sold domestically.
　The basic structure of the body is the same as the RE300, but it uses Pentax's K mount. This is probably because the EX mount has a narrow aperture, which hinders lens design, and the main reason is that it was difficult to implement AE with the RE mount (aperture priority AE is possible - the patent issue is Apart). Originally, Topcon was a manufacturer that was proactive in adding AE to cameras. The phantom camera AM-1, which was only announced at a later date, was also converted to AE. Migration to K mount for AE conversion. This camera played a role as a bridge to that end, but unfortunately Topcon chose to withdraw from the camera industry at this point. It must have been a difficult choice for Topcon to adopt a mount developed by another company. The feeling is different from the early EX mount. In fact, Topcon's decision to call the K mount AM mount and not to sell the RM300 in Japan seems to show some of this awareness (the ostensible reason being to avoid competition with the RE300). Rouga).
　The standard lens is AM Topkol MC 55mm F1.7, and the optical system is no different from RE Topkol, but the coating has been revised and is now multi-coated. However, unlike the REGN Topcoal M 50mm F1.4 for Super DM, the entire lens group is not multi-coated, but only the front element and some lenses in the middle are coated. The same goes for the interchangeable lenses, ranging from 28mm to 200mm in the K mount, but in addition to the 35-100mm zoom, a new AM zoom Topkor MC28-50mm F3.5-4.5 has been added.

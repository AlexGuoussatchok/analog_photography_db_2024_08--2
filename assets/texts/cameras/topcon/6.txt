Beseler TOPCON D-1
Beseler TOPCON D-1

　This is RE-2, a Becera brand for export to the United States, and the model name has been changed to D-1, and the position where the letters are engraved has been moved to the right. The name of the RE Super for Besellers was "Super D", so the name was chosen accordingly, but I think it would have been better to call it "D-2", but I don't know why they chose "1".
　Regardless, this camera has no mechanical differences from the domestic RE-2, and the accessories can be used as is. The image shows an accessory shoe attached, but instead of having a bayonet coupler at the base of the rewind crank like the RE Super, it was of the type that fit into the groove on the side of the viewfinder eyepiece like other companies' cameras at the time. It is designed to be used. The mounting pedestals for the magnifier and angle view finder also adopt this format.

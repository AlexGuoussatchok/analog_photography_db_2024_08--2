DeJUR DEKON
-SR

　Export version of Topcon PR II. The pentaprism cover has the letters "DeJUR" written on it, which is the name of an American photographic supplies trading company that mainly sold 8mm cameras, twin-lens reflex cameras, and compact cameras. Interestingly, Topcon had a sales contract with Becerra from the late 1950s and was supposed to be sold as Type A, but Primo JR had a contract with Sawyers, this camera with Dejua, and Uni and RE-2 with Honeymex. , each of which is for sale under that name.
　There is no difference from PR II other than the name. However, unlike the Honeymex and Becerra models, the TOPCON letters have completely disappeared, making it a so-called OEM product. As expected, the link between the winding mechanism and the shutter is weak, so this is prone to breakdowns, just like the PR II. However, the name "Simlar" has been revived for the lenses, including the conversion lenses.
Exportation version of the TOPCON PR II. Although the character of "DeJUR" is contained in the pentaprism cover, this is the name of the photograph article selling company in the United States. This company had sold 8mm cameras, TLR cameras, and compact cameras , etc. TOPCON had made a selling agreement with BESELER from the second half of the 50s. But Primo JR was sold with named "Sawyer's", and this camera was named "DeJUR DEKON SR", and TOPCON UNI & RE-2 were named HANIMEX TOPCON. There is no difference from PR II in addition to a name. However, unlike the model of HANIMEX or BESELER, the character of TOPCON has completely disappeared, and it is the so-called OEM model.
The linkage of the winding- up mechanism and a shutter is weak too, so this tends to break down to is the same as PR II.

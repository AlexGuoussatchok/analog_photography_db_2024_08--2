TOPCON PR 1st
model

　Released in 1959, Japan's first full-fledged lens-shutter single-lens reflex camera equipped with a pentaprism. The lens is a Topkor 5cm f2.8 Tessar type with 4 elements in 3 groups. The manual at the time proudly stated, ``Using a new type of glass containing rare elements.'' The mirror is not quick-return, and the aperture is manually preset, but interestingly, in order to prevent light from entering from the viewfinder side when the mirror is raised, there is a metal shutter that works with the shutter to block out light, located just inside the viewfinder eyepiece. is set up.
　The lens shutter uses Citizen MV, and the speed is selected in the range of B,1 to 1/500 seconds, but it is not a multiple series of 1/30 or 1/60 seconds, but 1 like old German cameras. Old shutter speed series such as /25 and 1/50 seconds are used.
　The dimensions and weight are 130 x 82 x 71 mm and the weight is 620 g, making it quite small and lightweight. The hood is available as a one-touch detachable type that can be attached by pressing the two buttons on the base. However, the mechanism is not as elaborate as that of the Topcon R hood, and it simply uses teeth that are retracted with a button in the groove.
　The photo above is of the early model, with a chrome barrel. The small circular knob on the left side of the lens when viewed from the front is the finger rest for the self-timer lever, and the rectangular knob below it is the finger rest for the preset aperture. When focusing, keep the aperture open with this button up, and when shooting, pull down to close down the aperture before pressing the shutter button.

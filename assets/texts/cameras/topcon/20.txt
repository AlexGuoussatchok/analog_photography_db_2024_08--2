TOPCON UNIREX black

finished

　This black body is similar to Uni's, and the lens barrel is also pitch black. Many other domestic manufacturers' single-lens reflex lenses originally had black barrels, so there is no problem, but in Topcon's case, the barrels were basically white, so making a black body requires a separate black barrel. In fact, it must have been quite a hassle. Looking back, I think we can see one side of Topcon's belief in the white lens barrel.
　There is no doubt that this Unirex model has the highest specs among all 35mm lens-shutter SLR cameras in camera history. If a manufacturer were to create a lens-shutter single-lens reflex camera in modern times, what kind of product would they produce?

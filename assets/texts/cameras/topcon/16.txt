TOPCON WINK MIRROR E
TOPCON WINK MIRROR E

　An upgraded version of the Wink Mirror released in 1961 with a built-in selenium light meter. Not yet EE. The lens is the same as the wink mirror, but the exposure meter sticks out in front of the pentaprism, covering most of the lens barrel, giving it a very different impression. The body is basically the same, but it's a bit more ungainly (although that's part of its charm). This camera does not have a helicoid ring for focusing, and the lens barrel is moved using a lever with a round finger rest visible to the right of the lens. The finger rest on the aperture lever at the top of the back is actually just a protrusion on the body and has no function.
　The lens got its name from this model, UV Topcoal, which is made by adding UV filtering ingredients to balsam to give it the effect of a UV filter. However, the structure of the lens itself is still the same as the wink mirror, and is 48mm F2.
　By the way, the exposure adjustment for this model is done in the viewfinder, but it is done using a pointer type. In other words, the needle, which moves up and down depending on the exposure, is tracked by changing the shutter speed and aperture value and moving another U-shaped frame in the viewfinder. It shows fairly accurate exposure, so even though it's a plein air type, it's something to behold.
　A common conversion lens was available for the wink mirror above and this E type, and there were two types: wide-angle 35mm and telephoto 80mm, but later the cheaper version TOKO AUX. WIDE-ANGLE LENS 35mm F4 and TOKO AUX. TELEPHOTO LENS 65mm F4 has been newly released ( see here for details ). In addition to this, microscope adapters are also now available. Please note that this nameplate is sometimes written as "Wink E Mirror", but this is incorrect.

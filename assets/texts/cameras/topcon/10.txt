TOPCON New IC-
1 AUTO Black

finished

　The New IC-1 also had a black body from the beginning. The standard lens in the image is HI Topkor 55mm F1.8, which has a slightly brighter aperture, but also has a longer focal length of 55mm. Additionally, the aperture of the rear lens has also increased accordingly, making it impossible to mount this lens on Uni or Unirex cameras because the aperture on the mount side is too small. In addition, the HI Sum Topkor 87-205mm F4.7 and the HI Topkor Auto Teleconverter 2x cannot be used due to caliber issues.
　As a result of the standard lens aperture of the New IC-1 being 1.8, "1.8" has been added to the aperture setting dial on the body side, and the previous "2" position has been changed to "・".
This is the minor change model of the IC-1 AUTO that was launched in 1976. The standard lens was upgraded to HI TOPCOR 55mmf1.8. This camera had disappeared completely in 78, because RE200 was launched right away. This is an inexpensive model , but it is the beautiful camera of the make as soundness.

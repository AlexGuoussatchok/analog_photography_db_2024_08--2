TOPCON RE-2
TOPCON RE-2

　Topcon already had the RE Super, a high-end system camera, and the UNI, an entry-level lens-shutter camera, but it was essential to develop an intermediate model that was most in demand on the market. Meanwhile, Tokyo Kogaku completed the Copal Square S vertically running metal blade focal plane shutter in a joint development with Copal, and the RE-2 was the intermediate model released in 1965 that incorporated this technology. Copal Square cameras at this time had a horizontal shutter axis, so other cameras that adopted this also had shutter dials on the front of the body or on the mount. Examples include Nikomart, Recoursing Rex TLS, and Konica Autorex. However, in 1968, the shutter unit was improved, and the Konica FTA, which adopted the new Square S, began to have the shutter dial placed in the general position on the warship section.
　Now, the major differences between this camera and the RE Super are that the viewfinder is now fixed, the aperture lever is omitted, and the X contact is no longer an automatic switching type, but the meter has also been significantly changed. The diaphragm, shutter, and meter were mechanically connected by a chain like in the RE Super, but the linkage around the meter was changed to a sliding type using electrical resistance. In other words, with the RE Super, the chain connecting the aperture and shutter was also connected to the meter side, and the meter body itself rotated to create a fixed point matching system, but the RE-2 has a fixed meter, so instead A sliding brush connected by a chain rotates on a dynamic resistance that controls the amount of information. In the case of the RE-2, when you turn on the power switch, a round indicator for indicating a fixed point appears in addition to the needle that comes out from the beginning. If you set the needle here, the exposure will be correct. However, the exposure meter confirmation window on the warship section seen on the RE Super is omitted on this camera.
　The shutter button also deviated from the flow of R~RE Super and was changed to one on a general warship. This is clearly a result of the shutter dial on the front taking up too much space, but this is not a bad thing. However, the shutter dial itself inevitably touches your right hand, and the grip feels a bit lacking. In order to avoid this as much as possible, the design has been designed so that when viewed from the front, the center where the mirror box is located is quite far to the right.

　A black body version of the RE-2 was also available, but since it rarely appears on the market, it seems that production numbers are quite low. As mentioned above, with the adoption of Copal Square S, the position of the mirror box has shifted considerably to the right, but in the case of this black body, the shutter dial, which was conspicuous on a chrome body, is also finished in black, so it is the same as the grained leather. Because it is not very noticeable, it gives off a truly fearless appearance. Also, like the RE Super and UNI, each part is completely finished in black, with only the shutter button and the eyelet for the strap being plated parts that are common to the chrome body. The camera body in the image has a film speed display in the shutter dial that is DIN for Europe, but of course there are also some that display ASA.

Contax G-l

The Contax G-l is the first genuinely new design in interchangeable-lens rangefinder cameras since the introduction of the Leica CL

Right off the bat, the engineers at Contax decided to house the G-l in titanium - a smart move. Press-corps duty can be brutal and housing a camera in titanium is the most effective means of prolonging its life. Underneath the titanium skin is an all-metal frame made from copper-silumin alloy, a material that Contax is using in all its latest SLRs now.

The G-1 ’s most significant feature is also a big departure from the Contax philosophy of “user control”: autofocus. The AF system uses an advanced passive
AF design with an extended base length to enhance autofocus accuracy.

The TTL meter is of the center-weighted averaging variety. The exposure modes provided are aperture-priority AE, manual, and TTL auto flash. Shutter speeds range from 16 seconds to 1/2000 (1 second to 1/2000 in manual), plus B, with X sync occurring at 1/100 second. The G-l has an integral motor that provides what has become the standard array of features: auto first-frame film wind and auto rewind, plus single and continuous frame advance modes at speeds up to 2 frames per second. Other features include an AE lock, eyepiece dioptric adjustment, and an adapter that will allow the user to fit Contax SLR lenses on the G-l.

Contax 139 Quartz

The Contax 139, released in 1979, is in some areas a scaled down version of the RTS and in other areas has a few features the RTS lacks. Like the RTS, the 139â€™s exposure modes are aperture-priority AE and metered manual, with exposure compensation. Added to the 139 is an auto-exposure lock and TTL flash with dedicated flash units.

Shutter speeds range from 11 seconds to 1/1000 (manual mode speeds are 1 second to 1/1000), plus B, with X sync at 1/100. Other features include a self-timer and a multiple exposure lever located on top of the camera.

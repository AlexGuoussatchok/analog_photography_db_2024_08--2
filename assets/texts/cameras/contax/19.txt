Contax Aria

Small, lightweight, and easy to use -those words seem to associate themselves naturally with the Contax Aria. But a closer examination will reveal a camera packed with features. It has a comprehensive array of exposure modes and options, which includes program, shutter-priority, and aperture-priority AE, manual exposure, three auto TTL flash modes, plus a manual flash mode. Exposure compensation (+/- 2 EV in 1/3-stop increments) and autobracketing are also available. Three metering patterns are available: five-segment evaluative, centerweighted averaging, and spot. Shutter speeds range from 16 seconds to 1/4000 second when in auto modes, and 4 seconds to 1/4000 in manual. Flash sync is at 1/125 second. The built-in winder advances film up to 3 frames per second and features auto film prewind and rewind. Other options include a 10-second electronic self-timer and interchangeable focusing screens. When used with a TLA flash, such as the TLA360, second-curtain flash sync is also available. A lot of camera for a reasonable sum - and one that just happens to take some of the finest lenses ever made.

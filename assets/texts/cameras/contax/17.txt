Contax 167MT

The Contax 167MT was the second Contax SLR designed to accept Contax MM lenses and was the sole remaining current production model until the introduction of the RTS III. As was mentioned with the 159MM, the Contax MM lenses must be used to engage either the 167MTâ€™s program or shutter-priority mode. Exposure modes include program with a three-stop shift feature, aperture and shutter-priority AE, and metered manual. Other exposure features include a safety shift, three-shot autobracketing, an AE lock and exposure compensation. Metering choices are centerweighted averaging and spot.

Shutter speeds range from 16 seconds to 1/4000, plus B, with X sync at 1/125. Other features include DX film coding with override, user-interchangeable focusing screens, depth-of-field preview, a self timer, TTL flash with dedicated units and a PC socket. Film is advanced via an integral motor drive at speeds up to 3 fps. The film handling features also include auto film loading and motorized rewind.

Contax RTS

The RTSâ€™ exposure features include aperture-priority AE and metered manual modes using a bottom-centerweighted metering pattern, exposure compensation and multi-exposure capability. Shutter speeds range from 4 seconds to 1/2000, plus B, with X sync at 1/60. Other features include user-interchangeable focusing screens, a self-timer and depth-of-field preview. The RTS Winder can be attached for motor-driven speeds up to 2 fps. There was also a motor drive made for the original RTS, called the Professional Motor Drive. The W-6 Professional Motor Drive (not to be confused with the aforementioned one), while designed for the RTS II, will function on the RTS, as well.

Contax 159MM

The Contax 159MM was the first Contax to utilize the new-style Zeiss MM lenses. To engage any of its three program modes, an MM lens must be used, although any bayonet Zeiss or Yashica lens may be used for its other exposure modes.

The 159MMâ€™s program modes are: HP, a high-speed program for shallow depth of field and/or stop-action photography; P, the standard program; and LP, a low-speed program for maximum depth of field. In addition, aperture-priority AE and metered manual are
available, as well as an AE lock and exposure compensation. Centerweighted metering is handled by silicon photo cells.

Shutter speeds range from 60 seconds to 1/4000 (1 second to 1/4000 in manual mode), plus B, with X sync occurring at 1/250 (1/100 in AE modes). TTL-OTF flash metering is available with dedicated flash units. Other exposure options include an AE lock and exposure compensation.

Other features include a self timer, depth-of-field preview, multiple exposure capability, interchangeable focusing screens (although not by the user) and power film winding with the optional W-7 Winder.

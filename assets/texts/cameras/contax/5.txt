Contax G2

As nice a camera as the G1 is, the G2 demonstrates resoundingly that it can be improved. On the G2, the built-in motor's continuous speed was doubled from the Glâ€™s 2 frames per second to 4 frames per second. A release-priority continuous AF mode was added, and top shutter speeds were increased to 1/6000 second. The focusing wheel was repositioned from the top to a more ergonomically suitable location on the front of the camera body. The viewfinder was enlarged and the AF system was improved, as well.

The AF system incorporates both external passive and active infrared focusing technology. Custom functions avail-
able include AE lock, autobracketing, film leader status (in or out), focus operation in manual focus mode, multiple exposure ISO setting, and more.

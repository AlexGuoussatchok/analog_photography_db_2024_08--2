Contax 137 MA Quartz

The 137MA superseded the 137 MD Quartz, and came with the following improvements: A manual exposure mode was added. The shutter speeds remain the same in the aperture-priority AE mode, but are 1 second to 1/1000 in the manual mode. Frame numbers are visible inside the full-information viewfinder. Exposure compensation was added, as was an AE lock. The integral winderâ€™s speed was boosted to 3 fps.

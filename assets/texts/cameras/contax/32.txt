Contax S2 & S2B

If you’re like many photographers who cut their teeth on mechanical, manual-focus, manual-exposure SLRs, and if you find yourself longing for the good old days, then news of the release of the Contax S2 may come as sweet comfort to your soul. Imagine a rugged, titanium-housed Nikon FM2, and you’ll have a pretty good picture of the Contax S2 (even the shutter speed dial is located where a non-Contax user would expect to find it). One unusual feature of the S2 is its metering pattern: indicated by the focusing screen’s microprism circle, the pattern is a 5 mm spot, which works out to about 2% of the image area - an unusual choice for a single metering pattern. Contax sees the prospective S2 user as a meticulous photographer, either a dedicated amateur or professional who needs the tight discrimination a spot meter provides. The S2B, however, employs the more conventional center-weighted metering pattern, which is, as far as I’ve been able to determine, the
only feature that distinguishes the S2B from the S2.

The S2’s mechanical, vertical-travelling, metal-bladed shutter provides speeds from 1 second to 1/4000, plus B, with X sync occurring at 1/250. Other features include interchangeable focusing screens, a mechanical self-timer, depth-of-field preview, a multiple-exposure lever, a semi-dedicated hot shoe (with dedicated Contax strobes, a ready light will illuminate in the viewfinder), a PC connector, and a manual ISO film-speed setting dial (No DX coding here, folks.).

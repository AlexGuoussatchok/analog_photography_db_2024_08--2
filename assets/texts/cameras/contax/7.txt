Contax RTS II

The RTS II features the same exposure options and metering pattern as the RTS. The shutter speed range was extended on the low end to 16 seconds (4 seconds in manual mode), plus B, with X sync at 1/60 (apparently, even though itâ€™s labeled as being 1/60, the actual mechanical shutter speed is 1/50 second). Only B and X sync operate without batteries. Other features include TTL flash automation with dedicated flash units, exposure compensation, an AE lock, interchangeable focusing screens, a self-timer and depth-of-field

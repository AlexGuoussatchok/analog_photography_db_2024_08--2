Minolta Vectis 40

The Vectis 40 is a solid APS workhorse, with sufficient features to handle most photographic necessities. Its 30-120mm f/3.5-9.9 zoom provides the 35mm equivalent of 38-150mm, with enough focal length on the long end to be useful for more than just snapshots. It has a close-up mode, focuses from 1.6 feet to infinity, and features five flash modes: auto, slow-sync, redeye reduction, and
fill flash. Shutter speeds range from 8 seconds to 1/500 second. The body is constructed to be “splashproof,” so it
should handle the elements reasonably well. APS features include mid-roll film change, select title backprinting, the C,
H, and P formats, date & time, and select title imprinting.

Maxxum 5xi

Just as the 7xi and 3xi replaced their respective i-series models, so did the 5xi replace the 5000i. And, like the 5000i, the 5xi fit squarely between the other two xi models in terms of price and features. The 5xi is housed in the same shell as the 3xi’s, but has many more of the 7xi’s features, and only weighs two ounces more than the 3xi.

The autofocus and exposure systems used in the 5xi are virtually identical to those found in the SPxi - single-shot, predictive autofocus, two metering modes (eight-segment evaluative and spot). Exposure modes available and shutter speed selections on the 5xi are the same as those found on the 3xi and SPxi.

As with other xi cameras, the 5xi supports the Eye-Start and Auto-Standby Zoom features when using xi lenses. The built-in winder can be set for either single-shot or continuous operation, and provides auto film loading and rewind, plus mid-roll rewind. DX coding is automatic, with no override. Many Creative Expansion cards can be used with the 5xi, some with only part of their features implemented. Some, like the function-change card, can’t be used at all.

Now, for the new stuff: The 5xi is the first Maxxum camera with a built-in flash that pops up and fires automatically when needed and retracts when not needed. This flash also has a zooming feature, which covers lens focal lengths from 28mm to 85mm and greater. Further, the flash works as an AF illuminator in low light. The 3500xi flash can be used with the 5xi and can be triggered off-camera, without the use of a PC cord (maximum flash-sync shutter speed when doing this is 1/45 second).

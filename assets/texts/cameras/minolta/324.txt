Maxxum 300si

If you think of the 300si as an interchangeable-lens point&shoot camera with a couple of exposure modes -well, to mix metaphors, you would be on the right track, but you would be missing the boat. Despite its lowly entry-level status, the camera remains a capable performer. All one needs to do is compare it to an entry-level Minolta SLR from another era, letâ€™s say the XG-1, for example, and one will see what I mean.

The autofocus system uses a single sensor passive predictive AF method. Metering is accomplished via an 8-segment evaluative system. Exposure modes consist of program AE, plus five Expert Program modes, which are Night Portrait, Portrait, Sports, Close-up, and Landscape. Exposure compensation is also available, as is TTL flash with redeye reduction via the built-in unit or external Maxxum flashes.

Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1 /2000 second, with flash sync occuring at 1/90 second. The built-in winder will advance film at the rate of one frame per second, and also features film prewind and end-of-the-roll rewind. Also present is an AE lock and a self timer.

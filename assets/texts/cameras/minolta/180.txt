Maxxum 9000

The Maxxum 9000 garnered rave reviews when it was released in 1986 -and for good reason. It was the first member of what has been until recently a very select group: professional-quality autofocus SLRs. Its robust construction, numerous built-in features and wide array of accessories still make it a useful, full-featured SLR. But, because it uses Minolta’s first generation of autofocus technology, it won’t focus with the speed of even current generation entry level cameras, and is miles behind the Maxxum 9xi. Until the 9xi’s introduction, the Maxxum 9000 had been the only Minolta SLR with a top flash sync speed of 1/250 second.

The 9000’s standard autofocus mode is continuous (servo) operation with an AF lock located in the shutter release. When the motor drive or winder is attached, single-shot (focus-priority) is also available. Metering modes are center weighted averaging and a tight 0.7% spot. Exposure modes include program with shift, aperture and shutter priority AE, metered manual and TTL flash with dedicated flash units. The metering can be biased for shooting in highlighted situations or shadows. Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/4000, plus B with an elapsed time indicator. Flash sync occurs at 1/250.

Other features include exposure compensation, a PC socket, built-in diopter correction, an eyepiece shutter, interchangeable focusing screens, multiple exposure capability, the retention of manual film advance and rewind capability, and a self-timer. A host of accessories were made for the 9000, from either a winder or motor option (continuous advance speeds to 5 tps with the motor) to a still video back with a video recorder.

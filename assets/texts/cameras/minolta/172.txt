Maxxum 600si

If one wants the retro look, push buttons are out, while knobs and dials are in. And since the Maxxum 600si has knobs and dials, it’s in. The advantage to the retro look, an apparent return to simplicity, is, well, simplicity. It is a lot easier to interpret a dial or knob’s function than it is to ferret out without benefit of an instruction manual, say, “push and hold this button while turning that wheel and watch the LCD display for this symbol.” Knowhatlmean?

In addition to being easy to understand and use, the 600si is a respectable camera, filled with a well-rounded selection of features.

The 600si’s AF system has a 3-sensor array with predictive AF capability, and operates using either auto or manual sensor selection. The 600si also has Minolta’s Omni-Directional Predictive Autofocus mode, which allows the user to track a subject anywhere in 3-dimensional space, whether accelerating or decelerating.

Exposure modes include program AE, shutter- and aperture-priority AE, and metered manual. Exposure compensation and autobracketing are also available.

Metering patterns consist of a 14-segment evaluative pattern, center-weighted averaging, and spot.

Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/4000 second, plus B, with flash sync at 1/200 second. The built-in winder features auto film prewind and end-of-roll rewind, and advances film at the rate of 2 frames per second. Other features include a self-timer, adjustable diopter correction, depth-of-field preview, DX film coding with override, and AE lock.

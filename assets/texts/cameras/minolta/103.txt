The success of the workhorse SR-T-series was largely responsible for positioning Minolta as a major player in the 35mm camera market. There are six basic models, most which underwent slight modifications during their production lives. Just to make matters confusing, though, the model numbers varied according to the countries in which they were sold. Following is a more-or-less chronological listing of SR-T cameras, with brief descriptions of features.
The SR-T 101 debuted in 1966. It is a full-size, full-featured, manual, mechanical SLR. The TTL CdS meter provides centerweighted average metering. Exposure is determined by the
match-needle method. Shutter speeds range from 1 second to 1/1000, plus B, with X sync at 1/60. The camera has a “cold shoe” (an accessory shoe without flash contacts) and PC sockets for X sync and FP bulbs. Other niceties include a depth-of-field preview lever and a self-timer. Most SRT-lOls have mirror lock up, although those made at the very end of the production run do not.

Maxxum 5000

The Maxxum 5000 is a simplified, less-costly version of the 7000 that retains its most often used features. A single autofocus mode, single-shot (focus priority), is available. Exposure modes are program and metered manual. Shutter speeds range from 4 seconds
to 1/2000, plus B, with X sync at 1/100. Other features include DX film coding, backlight compensation, a self-timer and a built-in 1.5 fps motor drive that provides auto film loading and rewind.

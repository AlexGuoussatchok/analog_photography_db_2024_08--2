Maxxum 7000i

The 7000i’s autofocus system features the following: it will switch automatically between continuous and one-shot, depending upon subject movement. Predictive focus was added, which allows the camera to track a moving subject, anticipating its location at the time of exposure. It has a wide-area, three-element array of focus sensors, sensitive to both horizontal and vertical subjects.
Exposure modes are program with shift, aperture and shutter priority AE, metered manual and TTL flash with auto fill flash, variable fill ratios and multi-strobe effects when using i-series flash units. The i-series Minoltas’ hot shoes will accept only i-series flashes, although Minolta does make an adapter that will allow use of standard ISO flashes. Metering modes include a six-zone multi-pattern evaluative mode and 2.3% spot, with standard centerweighted metering available in the manual exposure mode. Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/4000, plus B, with X sync at 1/125.

Other features include exposure compensation, a standard PC socket, multi-exposure capability, DX film coding with manual override, a built-in motor drive with film advance speeds up to 3 fps, and auto film loading and rewind.

A feature introduced with the 7000i is Minolta’s Creative Expansion Card library. The Creative Expansion Cards are plug-in modules that will customize the camera for fine-tuned control over such exposure situations as autobracketing, program shift, fantasy effects, data memory, highlight/shadow biasing and more.

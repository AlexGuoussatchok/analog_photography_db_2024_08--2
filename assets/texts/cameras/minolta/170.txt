Maxxum 500si

Continuing with the si evolution, the 500si is a camera that begins to spark a bit of interest for photographers who’ve begun to experiment with the art.

The 500si shares the same simple AF mode as found on the 400si, but exposure control has been expanded. The 500si has the same exposure features as found on the 400si, but added to the list are multiple exposure capabilities and Minolta’s Creative Exposure Control. This feature alios the user to choose shutter speed, aperture, or both, which amount essentially to a shiftable program function. Other exposure options include spot metering and slow-shutter flash sync. The built-in flash (GN 39 in ft. at ISO 100) offers redeye reduction and covers focal lengths down to 28mm.

Other features are a remote release terminal and a quieter film transport mechanism.

Maxxum 3000i

An even further simplified i-series camera, the 3000i is designed for the snapshot shooter who may wish to change lenses from time to time. Its wide-area AF sensor array provides one autofocus mode: one-shot (focus priority) with a limited predictive focusing capability. Metering modes are the same as those in the 5000i. It has two program modes: normal and high-speed program, but no manual exposure control. As with other i-series cameras, its hot shoe accepts only i-series flashes, but standard ISO units can be mounted with an optional adapter. Shutter speeds range from 4 seconds to 1/1000, with X sync at 1/60. Other features include a self-timer, integral motor drive with single frame advance, auto film loading and rewind.

Maxxum 7000

Minolta’s introduction of the Maxxum 7000 shook the 35mm photo industry to its very foundations. This single camera is ushered in explosion in autofocus technology that has continued unabated since its 1985 release. But a good thing can’t last forever; the Maxxum 7000 now suffers at the hands of the very revolution it began. By today’s standards, the 7000’s autofocus mechanism moves lenses into focus in a positively leisurely fashion. This isn’t to say its autofocus mechanism is slow, it’s
just that the latest generation of autofocus cameras now focus at seemingly instantaneous speeds.

The 7000 has two autofocus modes: one-shot (focus priority) and continuous (servo), with AF lock. Exposure modes are program with shift, aperture and shutter priority AE, metered manual and TTL-OTF (Off The Film plane) flash metering with dedicated flash units. Metering is performed by silicon photo cells in a centerweighted pattern. Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/2000, plus B, with X sync at 1/125. Other features include interchangeable focusing screens, a built-in film winder with continuous speeds up to 2 fps, a self-timer, DX film coding with override, auto film loading and rewind.

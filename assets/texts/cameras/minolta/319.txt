Maxxum 2xi

The littlest brother in the xi line to date, the Maxxum 2xi has enough features to keep most occasional photographers perfectly content. It is compact, lightweight and easy to use, yet contains the same fuzzy logic Expert Program routines that its more full-featured siblings have.

The 2xiâ€™s autofocus system uses a single wide-area CCD sensor to handle the focusing chores. The AF system will detect movement and switch automatically to the continuous focus mode, with predictive focus control.

Exposure modes include the following: Program AE, aperture and shutter-priority AE, and manual mode. The 2xi has two metering patterns: a seven-segment honeycomb pattern plus the background, and a spot meter, which uses the central honeycomb segment only. Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/2000 second. TTL flash exposure is also provided when a dedicated accessory flash is attached. An interesting flash option available with the 2xi is the slow shutter sync option. By depressing and holding the spot-metering button while taking the picture, a
slower shutter speed will be used, thereby increasing exposure of the background - handy for night scenes when one wants background detail brought out.

Other features include auto film advance and rewind, mid-roll rewind, single-frame film advance, DX film coding with no override, and a cancelable self-timer.

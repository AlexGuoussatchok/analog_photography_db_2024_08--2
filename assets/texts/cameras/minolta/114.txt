Minolta’s first series of SLRs consists of the various SR models. With the possible exception of the SR-M, all bear close resemblance to each other with only minor differences in features. Following is a brief overview.

The SR-1 has shutter speeds which range from 1 second to 1/500, plus B,
Minolta SR-7 with accessory ‘cold’ shoe. Note the meter window just below the film rewind crank.

with X sync at 1/60. Early SR-l’s have no depth-of-field preview button. Late SR-l’s have mirror lock-up and an attachment point for a non-TTL CdS exposure meter. The SR-Is appears to be identical to the late SR-1 (also known as the SR-1 Model V), and was produced concurrently with the SR-T 101. The SR-2 (Minolta’s first SLR) has a full range of shutter speeds, from 1 second to 1/1000, plus B, with X sync at 1/60. It was replaced by the SR-3, which featured a detachable selenium non-TTL exposure meter.

The SR-3 was superseded by the SR-7, which has a built-in non-TTL exposure meter coupled to the camera’s shutter speeds, and was tire first Minolta SLR (as far as I’ve been able to tell) with mirror lock-up. The SR-M was Minolta’s first motorized camera and was introduced four years after the SR-T 101. It has a built-in motor drive with a large, detachable hand grip and features both motorized film advance and rewind. It
also has mirror lock-up. The SR-M has no meter, nor does it have a provision for attaching one of the above accessory meters. All the above SR-series cameras have self-timers except the SR-M.

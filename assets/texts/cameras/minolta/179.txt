Maxxum 8000i

As if the 7000i didn’t have enough souped up capabilities, Minolta introduced the 8000i to leave little room for doubt that they could still go head to head with Nikon and Canon. Targeted at the Nikon N8008, the Maxxum 8000i is similar to the 7000i with the following additional features:

The top shutter speed was boosted to 1/8000, with X sync at 1/200 (1/180 with non-Maxxum flash units). A new, on-demand centerweighted metering pattern was added, as was an AF lock button. The 8000i has a high-eyepoint finder, a handy feature for eyeglass wearers. User-redefined ISO settings can be entered for any given DX code. Thus, if you expose your Kodachrome 64 at El 80, for exam-
pie, you can change the DX setting on the camera so that you don’t have to override the DX code manually every time you load a new roll - a nice feature.

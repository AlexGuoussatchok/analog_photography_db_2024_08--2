Pentax ZX-10

Intended as a camera that a tyro can “grow into,” the ZX-10 is simplicity itself in terms of user operation. Its Smart Picture Mode is designed so the camera will select an operating mode from five different Picture Modes (program, lanscape, close-up, action, and portrait) based on subject distance, subject movement, and lens focal length. Of course, the user can also select from these modes manually, as well as shutter-and aperture-priority AE, or metered manual.

The ZX-10 has a 3-sensor predictive AF system, plus its six-zone evaluative meter is linked to the active AF sensor to improve exposure accuracy. The built-in TTF flash features redeye reduction( GN 36 in ft. at ISO 100, covers down to 28mm lenses), plus there is a dedicated hot shoe for larger Pentax flash units.

Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/2000 second, plus B, with flash sync at 1/100 second. Other features include ± 3 EV exposure compensation, DX film coding with override capability, a self-timer, single frame advance and up to 2 frames per second advance with the integral motor drive, and three-speed power-zooming with Pentax FA lenses.

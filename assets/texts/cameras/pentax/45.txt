The Honeywell Pentax SLR camera for those who demand outstanding quality at a budget price, the Pentax Hla is the finest value today in the field of precision cameras! With the same classic no-nonsense body as the Pentax H3v, it differs only in that it does not feature the self-timer or auto-reset counter, has shutter speeds to 1/500 sec., and is equipped with the Super-Takumar f/2.0 lens.

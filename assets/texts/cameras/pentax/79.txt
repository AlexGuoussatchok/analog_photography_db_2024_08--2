The world's first single lens reflex camera with a behind-the-lens exposure system, the Spotmatic is the crowning achievement of the Honeywell Pen tax line.

Introduced in 1964, its instantaneous popularity has since made it the number one single lens reflex in the world. Its classic design is human engineered to make it the lightest full-frame SLR with behind-the-lens metering available today. The controls are precisely located to match normal movements of the user’s hands. Its no-nonsense shape combines precision and beauty into a timeless style.

Absolutely correct exposures are simple with the Spotmatic. Its CdS sensors read the light from the image focused on the ground glass— the same light that strikes the film itself. No matter which focal length lens is used, or whether filters, bellows or extension tubes are employed, the proper exposure is automatic and accurate. The Spotmatic also functions manually like other Pentax models.

The Spotmatic features: eye-level pentaprism finder with Fresnel lens; microprism and positive grid focusing; focal plane shutter; speeds from 1 to 1/1000 sec. plus Time; self timer; auto reset counter; ratchet film advance lever advances film and cocks shutter; FP and X flash terminals; very fast 50mm f/1.4 Super-Takumar lens or 55mm f/1.8 Super-Takumar lens.

Pentax ZX-M

Looking almost identical to the ZX-5N, the ZX-M moves into the place in the Pentax lineup previously occupied by the K-1000, the final incarnation of the Pentax Spotmatic. Following the same principle that was the hallmark of the K-1000, namely that simplicity is a virtue in and of itself, the ZX-M can be described as a bare-bones camera. But even so, it offers more features than the camera it replaced.

The ZX-M is a manual focus camera, but of course will accept all K-mount Pentax lenses. Exposure modes include program AE, shutter- and aperture-priority AE, plus metered manual. The camera uses a 2-segment metering system for centerweighted averaging metering. Programmed auto flash is available (auto setting of flash sync speed), but there is no TTL capability. Shutter speeds range from 20 seconds to 1/2000, plus B, with flash sync occuring at 1/100 second. The integral winder advances film in single frame and continuous modes at rates up to 2 frames per second. DX film coding with override is there, too. To round out the mix, the camera also includes a depth-of-field preview function and a self-timer.

Pentax ZX-50

Save for its two-tone silver and black color scheme, the ZX-50 appears to be
almost identical to the ZX-10. Intended as Pentaxâ€™s entry-level AF SLR, it still packs a respectable number of features into its compact and light body. Since the ZX-50 is essentially a simplified ZX-10, rather than relist all the features, only the differences between the two cameras will be addressed.

The ZX-50 has a simplified phasematching AF sensor that Pentax calls SAFOX V, rather than the three-sensor array found on tire ZX-10. The ZX-50 has the same Picture Modes found on the ZX-10, but loses the program AE setting. The ZX-50 loses the power zoom feature as well.

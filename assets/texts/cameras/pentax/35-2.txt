Pentax MX

The MX is the same size as the ME, but is a completely different camera. Designed for the serious student, the advanced amateur, or as a second camera for the working professional, the MX is a lightweight, but durable photographic tool and continues to be a top seller on the used market.

The MX provides manual exposure only, using a counterweighted meter with a match-diode display. The mechanical shutter speeds range from 1 second to 1 /1000, plus B, with X sync at 1/60. Other features include interchangeable focusing screens, a self-timer, depth of field preview, a hot shoe and either a winder or motor drive option.

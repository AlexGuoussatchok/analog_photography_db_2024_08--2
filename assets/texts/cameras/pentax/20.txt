Pentax SF-10

Essentially a scaled down SF-1, the SF-10 offers one autofocus mode: single-shot (focus priority). Exposure modes include program, aperture and shutter-priority AE and metered manual. TTL flash automation and auto fill flash are available with the built-in flash (GN 12 @ ISO 100) or with more powerful, optional dedicated strobe units. Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/2000 (1 second to 1/2000 in manual), plus B, with X sync at 1/100.

Other features include interchangeable focusing screens, DX film coding and an integral winder that provides auto film loading and rewind. The same restrictions regarding use of non-AF lenses on the SF-1 and SF-ln apply to the SF-10.

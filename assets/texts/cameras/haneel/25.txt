MULTIMODE COMPACT R4

Good though it was the R3 was in fact a stop-gap, intended to keep Leica in the market whilst it was developing a much more advanced camera. This emerged in 1980 as the R4, a new compact body retaining the manual and aperture-priority spot or averaging auto exposure modes of the R3 but with the addition of programme and shutter speed-priority modes. Interchangeable focussing screens were also featured and the camera was designed from the start to accept a motor drive or winder. The body is comfortable to hold, handles well and feels right, and it appealed immediately to those who thought that earlier Leica Reflex cameras compared unfavourably with the ‘M’ in these respects. Technically the R4 again put Leica right at the head of the field.

The R4 was in production for seven years. As would be expected, over such a period a number of internal improvements were made, resulting in a very well-proved camera.

Along with the R4 we should mention the R4s, introduced as a budget model in 1983. This is identical to the R4 except that the programme and shutter speed-priority modes are omitted. All other features are retained and many photographers found that the simpler model met their requirements more than adequately, with a worthwhile cost saving. In 1986 the R4s Model 2 (USA Model P) was introduced, with some minor detail changes.

All Leica SLRs, other than the very first Leicaflex, have incorporated a spot metering facility. It is interesting that after the introduction of the R4, other manufacturers began to recognise its merits for a competent user and to incorporate it into their flagship models.

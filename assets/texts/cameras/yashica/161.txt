The Yashica EZ-Matic Electronic is a viewfinder camera made for the 126 film cartridge introduced by Yashica in 1969. Its older brother, the original Yashica EZ-Matic, is pretty high-end for what it is with two exposure modes (automatic and aperture priority), accessory shoe, and self-timer. Unfortunately, this EZ-Matic Electronic variant has none of those things.

While the original EZ-Matic has a self-powered selenium light meter, the Electronic uses a battery-powered cadmium sulfide meter which can be found above the front element of the Yashinon 37mm f/2.8 lens. Besides focus, there are no manual controls to speak of which is common for many 126 cameras. The top plate houses the textured shutter button (which accepts a cable release) and a Flashcube socket while the film door release button is located on the user’s right hand of the camera. Instead of a traditional film advance lever, there’s a wheel located near the bottom of the back plate which is similar to what you would find on a 35mm disposable camera. Also located on the back is the button battery compartment.

I bought this EZ-Matic Electronic for $2.00 at a local flea market after its unusual looks caught my eye. Fortunately, it’s in pretty good condition due to its relatively rugged construction with only a few minor dings and scratches.

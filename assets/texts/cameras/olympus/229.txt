Olympus OM-88

The Olympus OM-88 is unique in that it is neither a manual-focus camera, nor is it an autofocus camera— it’s an almost autofocus camera, using a system Olympus called “Power Focus.” The camera accepts PF (Power Focus), AF and manual focus lenses. When using PF or AF lenses, the user pushes a button to focus the lens. This activates a motor that drives the lens in the focus direction desired - an interesting novelty, but not interesting enough, it would seem. The OM-88 was discontinued in 1991.

The OM-88’s exposure options include program, aperture-priority AE (when using manual focus lenses) and metered manual (with Manual Adapter 2). Shutter speeds range from 2 seconds to 1/2000, plus B (when using the optional Manual adapter 2), with X sync at 1/80. TTL flash is possible with dedicated flash units. Other features include a backlight control, a built-in singleframe-only motor drive, auto film loading and rewind, DX film coding with no override, a dedicated hot shoe and a self-timer.

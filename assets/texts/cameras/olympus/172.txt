Olympus Centurion and Centurion S

The lineage of the Centurion and Centurion S is unmistakable. Smart move, if you ask me, for Olympus to continue with the tried-and-proven IS-series design for an APS SLR. Except for cosmetics (the original is black and the S model has a brushed chrome look), the original Centurion and the S model are almost identical. The more recent S
model lacks a few of the features found on the original, but has some it doesn’t have. The Centurion has a non-detach-able 25 100mm f/4.5-5.6 aspherical lens. Shutter speeds range from 1 to 1/1000 second. Exposure modes include Program, Auto-Zoom Mode, Stop Action Mode, Portrait Mode, Landscape Mode, Infinity Mode, and Spot Mode. In addition to standard TTL auto, flash settings include Night-Scene Flash, Fill-In Flash, and a forced-off set-
ting. The film winder provides the standard set of features with single-frame advance only.

The Centurion S lost a few of the Centurion’s program features. Gone are the Auto-Zoom, Infinity, and Spot modes. Increased is the slow shutter speed setting, from 1 second to 4 seconds. In most modes, maximum flash sync occurs at 1/125, but in Portrait mode, the flash will sync at all speeds up to 1/2000.

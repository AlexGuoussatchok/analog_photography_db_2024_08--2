Carena KSM 1 carena KSM1

ã€€Karena is a photographic equipment trading company based in Liechtenstein that orders and sells cameras bearing its company brand from various manufacturers. The mounts were arranged differently depending on the camera ordered, and various mounts were introduced in the same advertisements at the same time. From 1975 to 1977, an OEM version of Petrimount's FTE was released at the same time as the M42 model, also made by Petri. This KSM 1 is a different name for the K-mount RM300, and there is also a KSM 2 that is almost the same but with a different name. The lens name has been changed to "Carenar", but the one in the image has a 35-100mm F3.5-4.3. The basic lens is 55mm F1.7, but in the case of Carena, interchangeable lenses are often ordered from other manufacturers, and you can also see Korean-made Carena lenses that are Topcon RE mount.

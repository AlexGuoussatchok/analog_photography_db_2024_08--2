The Agfa Parat-I is a fixed-lens half-frame 35mm cameras introduced by Agfa in 1963. There are a total of three nearly visually identical cameras released in 1963 that use the Parat name with a few key differences: the Parat-I (no meter), the Paramat (fixed shutter speed, automatic aperture control), and the Optima-Parat (automatic exposure system, different lens options).

Besides the rectangular shutter button with threaded cable socket, most of the controls on the front of the camera are located on the lens barrel. Two identical plastic tabs at eight and four o’clock on the lens barrel control the shutter speed and aperture while focus is set by turning the ring immediately surrounding the Color-Apotar 30mm f/2.8’s front element. The top plate is home to the film rewind knob, the accompanying film rewind release button, and the hot shoe which located just above the film advance lever on the back. The film door latch, tripod socket, and film counter are on the bottom.

I’m a great admirer of 1960s Agfa cameras and their sleek, stylish design so when I saw the Parat-I, I immediately found and bought one on eBay because knew I had to add one to my collection. I love its geometric angles, the compactness of its lens, and its overall form factor. I haven’t purchased many cameras based on looks alone, but this was one of them.

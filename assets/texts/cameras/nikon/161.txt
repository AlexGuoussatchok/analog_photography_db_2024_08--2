In 1976, Nikon refined the F2S and called it the F2 Photomic SB (DP-3 finder). The F2SB differs from the F2S in several areas, the most useful being an easier-to-use 3-LED readout in the viewfinder in the shapes of a minus sign, a zero and a plus sign. Obviously, the minus sign indicates underexposure, the plus sign indicates overexposure and the
zero indicates correct exposure. Silicon photodiode metering cells were incorporated into the DP-3 for faster metering response, as was an eyepiece shutter. Nikon also got rid of the hump. The slow speed metering ring and provision for the DS-1 or DS-2 were retained.

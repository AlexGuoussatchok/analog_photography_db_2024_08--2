The F Photomic, introduced in 1962, has a large, non-TTL finder with a round meter window in front of the shutter speed dial. An angle of acceptance restrictor and an incident light attachment came with the finder when new. Either one or both can be threaded into the meter window for use. When not in use, they are threaded into the finder’s side, one on top the other. It is not unusual to find Fs with early Photomic meters that are missing these accessories.
This finder exists in two variants: the early variant has a semaphore-style on-off lever that uncovers the metering cell when the meter is on, while the later
style uses a push-button to turn the meter on and off. Finders with the semaphore switch are generally priced somewhat higher than those with the push button. I haven’t separated the prices in the following listings, but one should lean a bit toward the higher end of the range when pricing the earlier model.

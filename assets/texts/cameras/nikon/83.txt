Nikon N50

Intended to replace the N5005, the N50 retains the ease of use that is necessary for the entry level model of a camera line, but it also has a well-rounded selection of more advanced features so that, as the user's capabilities grow, the camera can meet them. The N50 uses a “Simple/Advanced” dial. On the Simple setting, the tyro can choose between general, landscape, close-up, and portrait selections. Switched to Advanced, and the budding photojournalist can select between program with shift AE, shutter- and aperture-priority AE, metered manual (only with AF Nikkors, however), and other special programs. The built-in TTL flash even provides Nikon’s Matrix Balanced Fill-Flash.Focusing modes consist of single shot AF, continuous predictive AF, and manual. The metering system, in AE modes, uses a six-segment evaluative system, while in manual mode, it uses cen-terweighted averaging. Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/2000, plus T (a good substitute for B, since it does not have a provision for a cable release). The built-in motor drive provides singleframe advance, as well as film prewind and end-of-roll rewind. Other features include DX coding with override, and ± 5 EV exposure compensation.

Nikon N60

The N60 replaces the N50 as Nikon’s entry level autofocus SLR model, yet offers a suite of features that most any photographer, regardless of abilities, will find useful. The concept behind the N60 is that a compleat neophyte can pick one up, switch it on, and begin taking correctly exposed and sharp pictures from the git-go. In this respect, Nikon has borrowed a concept that Canon introduced several years ago, known as the PHD (Push Here Dummy) setting. The key to the successful proliferation of the PHD setting is the fact that it works surprisingly well. It is generally so accurate that it has been known, in fact, to cause accomplished photographers just to say, “Aw, what the hey,” set it to PHD, and fire away. Nikon gives this PHD setting found on the N60 the inauspicious title of “General-Purpose Program.”

Autofocusing on the N60 is automated simplicity as well. It’s called Auto-Servo AF, where the camera will automatically choose between Single-Servo AF or Continuous Servo AF, depending upon subject movement. Exposure modes include the aforementioned General-Purpose Program, plus Auto-Multi Program (essentially a program mode with shift), shutter- and aperture-priority auto, metered manual, plus five
Vari-Program modes (Portrait, Landscape, Close-Up, Sport, Night Scene). Exposure compensation of ± 3 EV in fi-step increments is also available. Metering modes consist of Nikon’s excellent 3-D Matrix available with D-type Nikkors, six-segment Matrix with non-D-type AF Nikkors, and center-weighted averaging in manual or with the AE-lock engaged.

Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/2000 second with flash sync at 1/125 second. Other features include an integral winder with auto film wind and rewind and continuous speeds up to 1 frame per second, a self-timer, diopter adjustment, a built-in TTL flash with redeye reduction, and a hot shoe.

The F3AF debuted in 1983 and was an early attempt at autofocus. Its autofocus system provides continuous focusing only, and is housed entirely in the removable finder, which results in a very large finder and a top-heavy-looking camera. Unlike other autofocus Nikon SLRs, the F3AF does not autofocus by using a mechanical drive coupling between camera and lens. Instead, focus information is communicated by a series of electrical contacts in the base of the finder through a set of pin contacts in the camera body to electrical contacts on the two autofocus lenses made for this camera. These lenses, the AF 80mm f/2.8 and the AF 200mm f/3.5, contain their own drive motors and will autofocus on the F3AF only (power for the motors is supplied by two AAA batteries housed in the finder). The F3AF accepts manual focus lenses and provides focus confirmation with lenses of f/3.5 and faster maximum apertures. Standard F3 finders can be used on the F3AF and the F3AF finder (DX-1) can be used on a standard F3. It will provide focus confirmation, but not autofocus.

The F3T is an F3HP housed in Titanium. It has been produced in two color schemes: standard black and champagne. The champagne model’s top plate, bottom plate and finder are a muted pink chrome color. That’s right, pink. If you’ve never seen one, trust me, the camera looks much better than it sounds. In fact, the champagne F3 is the
more durable of the two cameras, because there is no paint to chip or wear off. I once came across a few champagne F3Ts that were veterans of several years of heavy press corps duty. It was obvious they had been used heavily because of the deep wear they exhibited. But, amazingly enough, not one had a dent or ding anywhere! When Nikon stated in the brochure, “Bump it. Bang it,” they weren’t kidding.

Now that the F4 has come and gone and been obsolesced by the F5, and now that working professionals have come to rely on the hi-tech marvels of modern computerized photo technology, many of them have long since dumped their F3s. This activity has resulted in a deluge of F3s on the used market that first began back in the late 1980s. Despite this, however, the F3 has retained its value on the used market surprisingly well. The camera has actually shown an admirable degree of longevity, having been in production now longer than any other F-series camera. Nikon states it will continue to produce the F3 for as long as there is a demand for it. It would appear there is, to the point where Nikon introduced (or perhaps “reintroduced” might be a better word), for a short time at least, the F3HP Press, highly reminiscent of the discontinued, and much missed, F3P.

Other basic features not listed above, yet common to all F3s include: a strongly centerweighted (80/20) metering pattern; shutter speeds ranging from 8 seconds to 1/2000, plus B and T, with X sync at 1/80; interchangeable focusing screens, finders and backs; depth-of-field preview; and mirror lock-up.

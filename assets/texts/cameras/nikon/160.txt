The F2 Photomic S (DP-2 finder) was introduced in 1973. The three principal differences between the F2S and the F2 Photomic were: 1. The addition of a slow-speed ring above the shutter speed ring, which, when engaged, allows the DP-2 to meter down to 10 seconds. 2. Nikon had caught LED fever by then and substituted the meter needle for two LEDs. When both are lit, exposure is correct. 3. The addition of a coupler for the EE Aperture Control Attachment DS-1 or DS-2, which allowed the camera to be used in shutter-priority AE. The DP-2 finder also developed a strange hump on top to house the LEDs.

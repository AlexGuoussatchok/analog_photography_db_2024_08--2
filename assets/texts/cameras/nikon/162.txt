The F2 Photomic A (DP-11 finder), introduced in 1977, was the first Nikon to allow automatic indexing (AI) of the lens’ maximum aperture. The
F2A’s appearance is very close to that of the original F2 Photomic, but can be told apart easily by the small white “A” at the lower right front of the viewfinder just above the AI coupling lever. The F2 Photomic A has no provisions for attaching the DS-1 or DS-2.

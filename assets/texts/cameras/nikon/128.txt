The Nikon F2

The Nikon F2, billed by Nikon as an improved version of the original F during its 1971 debut, was in reality a totally new design. Many regard the F2 as the finest mechanical 35mm SLR ever built. It was Nikon’s last hand-built camera. Clean examples are still highly prized and much sought after.

The serial numbering system that evolved with the F continued with the F2, which allows one to arrive at its
approximate date of manufacture by looking at the first two digits. It should be reemphasized that this method only approximates years of manufacture. The most convincing argument in favor of this view is based on Nikon’s later habit of coordinating serial numbers with trim. F2s displaying serial numbers beginning with 74, 76, 78 and 80 have chrome trim, whereas F2s having serial numbers beginning with 75, 77 and 79 have black trim. It seems highly unlikely that Nikon would have devoted an entire year’s production to only one type of finish. Earlier F2s having serial numbers beginning with 71, 72 and 73 can be either black or chrome. It seems likely that these cameras’ serial numbers more closely approximate their actual years of manufacture than later ones do.

The F2, like the F, depends on the viewfinder that is attached for its exposure metering options, and it is the meter that determines the model (e.g., an F2 with a DP-1 finder is an F2 Photomic). Also, as with the F, it is not uncommon to see earlier F2s with late model finders, especially the DP-11 (F2A) and DP-12 (F2AS) finders.

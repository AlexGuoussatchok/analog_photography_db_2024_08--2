The Nikon F Apollo is an F with an F2-style film advance lever and self-timer. These cameras appeared late in the 73 number run and throughout the 74 number run. Apparently, the “Apollo” moniker was assigned by collectors due to the belief that this camera was associated with the NASA Apollo space program. From what I have been able to uncover, however, the Nikon Fs used by the Apollo program are entirely different animals, having been extensively modified not only for the special rigors and requirements of the space program, but for use with the bulky gloves that the astronauts wore. For whatever reason, however, the nickname has stuck, and is sure to generate much future speculation as to its origin, whether in print, in Usenet newsgroups and mailing lists on the internet, or around the dealer tables at camera shows, for years to come.

Exposure metering with the Nikon F is handled by the viewfinder, so it’s common to see early model bodies with late model finders. The derivations of the Nikon F are determined by its viewfinder. For those of you who may not know
the differences between them, they are: The meterless F has the standard, traditional-looking, pentaprism-shaped viewfinder with a large “F” inscribed on the front.

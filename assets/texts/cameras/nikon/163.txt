Nikon’s last variant of the F2, the F2 Photomic AS (DP-12 finder), also introduced in 1977, is the A1 version of the F2SB. Like the F2A, the F2AS can be identified by the white “AS” located above the AI coupling lever. Shutter-priority AE is possible with the F2AS when using the Aperture Control Attachment DS-12.

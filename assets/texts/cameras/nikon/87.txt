Nikon N70

The N70 sits squarely in the middle of Nikon’s autofocus SLR lineup, loaded with many advanced features rivaling those found on the N90s, while commanding roughly half the price. Such a camera makes an ideal choice for the thoughtful amateur, and can arguably be a reasonably astute selection as a backup or second camera for the working professional.

Autofocusing modes include single shot and continuous predictive AF. The user can select between wide-area AF and spot AF for better focusing control, same as on the N90 and N90s. The N70 also sports focus tracking with Lock-On, and will track subjects at frame rates up to 3.1 frames per second. The N90s’ metering systems are also shared by the N70 - eight-segment Matrix, 75/25 centerweighted, and spot. In addition, the N70 also features 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-flash with both the built-in flash and accessory Nikon Speedlights. The two cameras also share almost identical exposure modes: program AE with shift, shutter- and aperture-priority AE, and metered manual, but the N70 has eight Vari-Program modes compared to
the N90s’ seven. Added to the N70’s Vari-Program lineup are “low-light” and “slow-shutter blur”, but deleted is the portrait-with-red-eye-reduction Vari-Program found on the N90s.

Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/4000 second, with flash sync at 1/125 second. The integral winder has three settings: single frame, continuous low speed (2 frames per second), and continuous high speed (3.7 frames per second). Other features include a Quick Recall function, which allows the user to recall the factory default point-and-shoot setting or one of three user configurable settings, a high-eyepoint viewfinder, an AE lock button, and a built-in flash with coverage down to 28mm.

Nikon Pronea S

Nikon continues the “so simple, anybody can take great pictures” theme with the Pronea S. With fewer features than its bigger brother, the 6i, it is perhaps intended for users who are more point-and-shoot oriented. But it still has enough features and inherent picturetaking ability to handle most photographic situations with ease.

Rather than list all the features of the Pronea S, let’s look at what it has (or doesn’t have) in relation to the 6i. Here are the differences in a nutshell:

The Pronea S does not have a full manual exposure mode. It has a single metering mode, Nikon’s excellent 6-seg-ment 3-D Matrix metering (no center-weighted or spot capabilities). The top shutter speed is 1 /2000 second, instead of the 6i’s 1/4000 second, and the flash sync speed is 1/125, instead of 1/180. The Pronea S has ± 2 EV of exposure compensation in 1/2-step increments, not the ± 5 EV found on die 6i. It has no bracketing feature. The flash is somewhat less powerful (ISO 200 GN of 52 in ft.) and its coverage is less (24mm instead of 20mm). The Pronea S’s integral winder does not have a continuous shooting mode.

Nikon’s AM280F TTL phase-detection module handles both moving and stationary subjects with aplomb. The AF system autmatically selects between single-shot and continous AF with focus tracking, depending upon subject movement.

In terms of APS features (please refer to explanations of each at the beginning of the APS section), the Pronea S supports all three image formats (Classic, HDTV, and Panoramic), Print Quality Improvement, Title Back Imprint (30 different ones in 12 languages), Date/TIme Imprint (front or back), and Mid-Roll Change.

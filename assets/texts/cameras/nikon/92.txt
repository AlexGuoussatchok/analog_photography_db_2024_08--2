Nikon N2000 & N2020

The N2000 was Nikon's first 35mm SLR with a built-in motor drive and the second Nikon to support the “s” feature of AIs lenses. Its centerweighted metering pattern is used for all four exposure modes: standard program, high-speed program (AIs lenses are necessary to engage this function), aperture-priority AE and metered manual. Other exposure features include TTL flash metering with dedicated flash units, an AE lock and exposure compensation. Shutter speeds range from 1 second to 1/1000, plus B, with X sync at 1/125. Other features include DX film coding with override, a self-timer and, as was mentioned above, an integral motor drive that has continu-
ous speeds up to 2.5 fps. The motor features auto film loading, but film must be rewound manually.
Nikon’s second autofocus SLR, the N2020, is an N2000 with the addition of two autofocus modes: single shot (focus priority) and continuous (servo). All AF-Nikkors will autofocus on the N2020 (except those for the F3AF and some of the D-type AF Nikkors). Focus confirmation is provided for with AJ’d, AI, or AIs lenses.

Nikon FA

The Nikon FA, as a discontinued camera, is more popular now than when it was available new. Nikonâ€™s Automatic Multi-Pattern Metering (AMP) system, originally introduced with the FA, is the same basic metering pattern still employed in the latest Nikons, such as the N8008s and F4. The FA was also the first Nikon to support the AIs feature.

The FA features a 1/4000 second top shutter speed with flash sync at 1/250 and five exposure modes: metered manual, aperture and shutter-priority AE, and two program modes: standard and high-speed (with AIs lenses, the camera will bias shutter speeds automatically according to the focal length mounted), plus cybernetic override just in case the user makes a mistake with one of his or her choices.

Other features include exposure compensation, interchangeable focusing screens, TTL flash metering with dedicated flash units, multiple exposure capability, depth-of-field preview, a self-timer and a motor drive option using either
the MD-11, MD-12 or MD-15. While the MD-11 and MD-12 motor drives offer slightly higher top speeds (3.5 fps vs. 3.2 fps), the MD-15 will supply power to the FA in the event of on-board battery failure.

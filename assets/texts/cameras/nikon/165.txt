The F3P is the “professional” model F3HP. Many people have found this designation confusing since the F3 is, after all, a professional-level camera. It turns out the F3 often becomes temperamental in the damp and just flat refuses to work in very cold weather. It has to be “winterized” to work properly.
Nikon’s answer to this problem was the F3P, conceived plainly with the idea of inclement weather in mind.
The F3P is thoroughly gasketed against moisture intrusion. The shutter speed dial is oversized and the main on-off switch was redesigned, both changes made for ease of operation with gloved hands. The cable release socket was eliminated, as was the self-timer, the eyepiece shutter, the camera back lock lever, and the multiple-exposure lever. One nice addition is a hot shoe atop the removable, titanium-clad finder (although it’s non-TTL). The camera comes standard with the Type B focusing screen and the MF-6B back, which leaves the film leader protruding from the film cassette after power-rewinding the film with the MD-4 motor drive. Many pros grouse that this camera is the F3 Nikon should have built from the beginning. Did Nikon take this
well-meaning criticism to heart? Well, yes - but it took them a while. The camera was discontinued in 1989, but as near as I can determine, Nikon, has replaced the F3T with an updated model called the F3HP Press, which appears to be identical to the F3P. In the following price listings, I have the F3HP Press listed separately from the F3P, although I may combine the two at a future date.

In 1955 the DeJur-Amsco company marketed the DeJur D-1 a solid cast-metal bodied camera made by Neidig Kamerawerk. The D-1 is basically the 1952 Perlux II camera with the DeJur name and updated with a double-stroke lever wind instead of a knob wind. It is a viewfinder 35mm with interchangeable lenses. The standard lens is a 45mm f/2.8 Staeble-Kata in a (unbranded) Prontor shutter with speeds of 1/25 to 1/200. There were two accessory lenses available; a 38mm f/3.5 Staeble-Choro and a 85mm f/5.6 Staeble-Telon. As a set they were supplied in a nice leather case together with an accessory viewfinder. They are the same M39 thread mount Staeble lenses that were offered to fit the Braun Paxette II. The accessory finder shows the wide-angle view; a slip-on mask is used with the tele lens.

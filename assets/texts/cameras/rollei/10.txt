The 6008 SRC 1000 differs from the 6008 in only a couple of areas. The SRC, by the way, stands for Scanning Remote Control - we’ll get to that shortly. As you may have guessed the “1000” in its name refers to its top shutter speed. The SRC 1000 has the 1/1000 second shutter speed indicated on the shutter speed dial. The older 6008 has two marked (but unlabeled) detents above 1/500, one for 1/750 and the other for 1/1000. They were not labeled on the original 6008 because the high speed leaf shutters were still in development when the camera was ready for release. The 1/750 detent was dropped from the SRC 1000’s dial.

The other difference came about as a result of a new accessory for the 6008 and the 6003: Rollei’s Digital ScanPack. The Digital ScanPack allows the Rollei 6008 SRC 1000 to interface directly with a Macintosh II or IBM-compatible 80386 or higher with a min-
imum of 8 MB RAM and 100 MB of free hard disk storage space, and converts it to a state-of-the-art ultra high-resolution digital imaging scanner. Because the Digital ScanPack requires relatively long exposure times (3 seconds and up), the shutter was redesigned so that it is not held open by an electromagnet on the B setting, eliminating battery drain during long exposures. This improvement will not only be of interest to those working with digital imaging, but to other photographers who regularly use long exposure times in their work.

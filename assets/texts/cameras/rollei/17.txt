Rollei defines precision

Precision is a quality you can hear and feel in the new Rolleiflex SL35M 35mm SLR. The uniquely competent sound when you release the shutter. The instant-return mirror is virtually silent and vibration free. The silken smoothness of the perfectly finished Rollei quick-change bayonet mount when you interchange lenses. The positive response of the winding mechanism as you advance the film. The Rollei SL35M offers you painstaking German design and a standard of precision that few cameras can match.

This latest model comes with a new rugged look as standard equipment. Professional black, of course, with a sure-grip surface on the camera body for easy handling. Inside, there's full-aperture metering for precise, convenient exposure control.

The new SL35M offers the features the demanding photographer wants. A large, extra-bright finder with exposure indicators, lens f/stop readout and a diagonal split-image rangefinder with microprism grid and groundglass collar, for positive eye-level control... a short-stroke rapid advance lever does double duty as the meter switch... and a host of other niceties you expect to be standard on a camera with the Rollei name.

Equally essential, equally precise, is the Rollei 35mm SLR system, including bellows, automatic extension tubes, lens adapters, microscope adapter, filters, hoods, cases and most especially the lenses themselves. Focal lengths from 16mm through 200mm, all equipped for full-aperture metering. They are among the finest optics made in the world today... each distinguished by the appelation HFT: High Fidelity Transfer. Multi-layer coating, floating elements, sophisticated electronic testing techniques.

The result: increased image contrast, light transmission, and color saturation.

This, too, is precision. It is a word synonymous with Rollei, now given new expression by the Rolleiflex SL35M.

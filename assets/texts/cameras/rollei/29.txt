Rolleiflex SLX

Introduced in 1977, the SLX was the first model of the new-look Rollei medium format SLRs. Its exposure modes are shutter-priority AE and non-metered manual. In the shutter-priority mode, a centerweighted metering pattern is used. The SLX does not have a provision for mid-roll film back interchangeability. Instead, it uses a fixed (but removable) back into which one pops a pre-loaded film insert. In addition to the above features, the SLX also has a PCsocket and a depth-of-field preview button that doubles as a AE lock.

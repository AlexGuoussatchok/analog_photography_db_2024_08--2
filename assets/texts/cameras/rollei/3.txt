Rolleiflex SL66

The SL66 was Rollei’s first medium format SLR. It’s a mechanical camera and has no built-in meter. The SL66 system is, in the tradition of medium format SLRs, a totally modular one, accepting a wide array of interchangeable finders, focusing screens, lenses and backs. It also has a focal plane shutter, with shutter speeds ranging from 1 second to 1/1000, plus B and with X sync at 1/30 second. Instead of using the more traditional integral focusing helicals, lenses on the SL66 are focused by racking a bellows in and out of the body. Such a system allows for greater close-up focusing flexibility than would otherwise be possible. Another nice feature, one which remains unique to the SL66 line, is Rollei’s Retromounting®, which allows some lenses to be reverse-mounted without the use of accessory adapters, giving the photographer easy access to the world of high-magnification photography without having to incur a lot of additional expense. And, in its effort to add
even further control to the final image, Rollei decided to give the SL66 a tilt feature, allowing for ±8 degrees of movement. The SL66 also has a PC connector, a hot shoe, a cable release socket, multiple exposure capability and a mirror pre-release.

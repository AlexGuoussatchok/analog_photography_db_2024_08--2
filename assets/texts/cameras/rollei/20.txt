Rolleiflex 6002

The 6002 was introduced after the 6006 as a more economical model. Like the SLX, it does not have a provision for changing backs in mid-roll.

Three exposure modes are available: shutter-priority AE, non-metered manual and TTL auto flash with SCA-356 compatible flash units. For metering, a centerweighted pattern is used. The 6002 also has a PC socket in addition to the dedicated hot shoe and a depth-of-field preview button that doubles as an AE lock.

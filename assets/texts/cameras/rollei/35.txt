Rolleiflex SL66SE

The SL66SE is similar to the SL66E, with significant improvements. It has three TTL metering patterns: a bottom-centerweighted multi-zone averaging pattern, a spot pattern, and TTL flash metering with SCA 356-compatible flash units. Exposure options include metered manual, shutter-priority AE, aperture-priority AE and TTL auto flash.

The Petri Color 35 is a very compact viewfinder camera with an excellent feel and design, manufactured in 1968 by the Japanese company Kuribayashi - Petri. Extraordinary: Aperture and exposure time are set via 2 wheels at the top right of the camera, not on the lens as usual. In the viewfinder you can see a pointer on the right to check. If this pointer is exactly in the middle of the scale, the exposure is correct. The exposure is measured via a CDS cell at the front of the lens - changes in lighting conditions caused by screwed-on filters are taken into account. You don't focus on the lens, you adjust the distance with the wheel between the viewfinder and the quick-release lever. This wheel is used to focus when the lens is extended and the lens is retracted. The distance symbols are arranged at the bottom of the bright viewfinder. The Petri Color 35 is equipped with a 4-element 1:2.8/40mm Petri CC lens. The lens draws sharply. The trigger is located in the time selector wheel and is equipped with a thread for a cable release. The image counter and the transport lever are located on the back of the camera. The camera has a hot shoe at the top and a plug for the synchronization cable at the front. The back wall is completely removed to insert film. Also worth mentioning is the unique folding rewind crank on the top of the camera.

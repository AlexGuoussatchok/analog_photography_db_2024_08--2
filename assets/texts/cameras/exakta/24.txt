EXAKTA EDX 2 EXAKTA EDX 2

　The Topcon RE series, which was originally developed using the Exacta mount, coincidentally ended up receiving orders for and producing a model bearing the name of the original Exacta towards the end of its life. This Exacta EDX2 is a different name from the RE200, and the OEM model EDX3 of the RE300, a high-end version that can be used with an auto winder, was also sold at the same time. Accordingly, the lens name was changed to "EXAKTAR".
　At that time, Ihagee West placed orders not only with Topcon but also with multiple Japanese manufacturers, and in 1976 ordered Petri with the FE2000 and TL1000 ( see here ). Petri went bankrupt in 1977, so they probably ordered it from Topcon as a continuation, but since Petri used the M42 and this one has an exacta mount, it can be said that it has returned to its original form in a sense. In any case, I feel that Topcon, which made single-lens reflex cameras using the Exacta mount, which was a universal mount in the 1950s, is selling cameras to Exacta.

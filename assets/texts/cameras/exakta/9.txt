EXAKTA KE 4 EXAKTA KE4

ã€€Unlike the Exacta EDX series, it is a renamed version of the Topcon RM300, so the K mount is used instead of the previous EX/Topcon RE mount. The lens name continued to be EXAKTAR, but since the RM300 was already multi-coated, the cosmetic ring also had the letters "MC" engraved on it. There is no difference from EDX3 other than the mount change. If I were to point out any changes from the RM300, it would be that the self-timer's countersunk screw, winding lever, and rewinding crank are all finished in black, just like the EDX3.

Rony RS1
Rony RS1

ã€€It's not a traditional brand like Exacta or Edixa, but a photo trading company brand similar to Kantaray and Carena, which will be mentioned later, and there is a model called Ronnie RS1 that was exported to France. This brand called Rony had previously released a camera called Rony EMC/750, which is the same OEM model as the famous Digital 750 from Yashima/Osanon. Mechanically, it was a high-tech camera as it achieved aperture-priority AE even though it was an M42 mount, but it seemed like it lacked passion and could never be called a successful model. After that, he changed the name to the extremely simple Topcon RM300 and switched to this RS1, which just had Rony's plate attached, but it seems that this was not ordered in large quantities, and it is a minor model that is rarely seen on the second-hand market. It is. Mechanically, it is completely the same as the RM300, and the lens only has a cosmetic ring that changes the name to "RONY MC 55mm F1.7".

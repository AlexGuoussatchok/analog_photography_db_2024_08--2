CIMKO LS-1
CIMKO LS-1

　In 1981, when Tokyo Kogaku withdrew from the consumer 35mm camera market, development of its new model, the AM-1, was almost complete. Shima Optics, a subcontractor that took over the company, established a new company, Shima, and released the Shimco LS-1 in 1983 as the aperture-priority AE K-mount model. Although there are very few changes, it is almost the same as the AM-1. Many of the interchangeable lenses that were released at the same time were AM Topkol lenses, but Shimco also produced many unique lenses, mainly rear zoom lenses. With the establishment of Cima, several employees who were involved in camera and lens design at Tokyo Kogaku also moved to different places, and this camera has the authenticity of Topcon's blood running through it. However, the standard lens is 50mm instead of 55mm, making it a smaller lens with a different design. The camera body is also much smaller, and the construction is much more solid compared to the RM300.
　From the late 70's to the early 80's, compact and lightweight AE single-lens reflex cameras were popular, and autowinders became essential items. This camera also had a 2 frames per second winder. However, in Japan, even though they made attractive cameras under the SIMCO brand, the market did not turn around, and Cima was perceived as a third-party interchangeable lens manufacturer. In addition, it seems that they were selling lenses in various brands overseas rather than domestically, and their mainstay was still lenses rather than camera bodies.

If you’ve ever felt the need for a camera that accepts autofocus lenses, but doesn’t autofocus, then the EF-M (EF lenses-Manual focus) may be the one for you. Canon designed the EF-M with the photography student in mind, since often students are not allowed to use autofocus cameras in their course work.

The EF-M’s exposure modes consist of program, shutter and aperture-priority' AE, and metered manual. The metering modes include 3-zone evaluative (for program), centerweighted (for shutter-priority AE, aperture-priority AE and manual), and partial metering. The latter can be selected by the user at any time. Other exposure features include exposure compensation and AE lock.
Shutter speeds range from 2 seconds to 1/1000 second, plus B, with X sync at 1/90. The hot shoe has dedicated flash contacts for the Speedlite 200M, but does not offer TTL flash metering. Other features include DX film coding with override and a self-timer.

The EF-M has a built-in single-shot winder that prewinds to the end of the roll. Auto film rewind and mid-roll rewind are available.

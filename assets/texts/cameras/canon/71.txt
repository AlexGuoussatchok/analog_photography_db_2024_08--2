EOS 630

The EOS 630 replaced die 620, although it lacks a couple of features its predecessor has, most notably the top shutter speed and flash sync. Bodi speeds got bumped down a notch with the 630 to 1/2000 and 1/125, respectively.
The 630 makes up for this with a host of improvements. For starters, Canon claimed the 630 focuses twice as fast as previous models (the 620 and 650). It still has two AF modes, one-shot (focus-priority) and continuous (servo), but the latter was improved with an added “Focus Prediction” feature for
sharper results when shooting highspeed action photos. To complement this faster autofocus capability, the motor drive’s speed was boosted to 5 fps (slower when tracking moving subjects in the continuous AF mode).

The 630 combines the best exposure modes of the 650 and 620, plus a
lot more. In addition to program with shift, aperture and shutter-priority AE, and metered manual modes, are both depth-of-field AE and auto-bracketing. It also has Canon’s “Programmed Image Control” (PIC) system, a set of seven preset program modes, and “Custom Function Control,” a set of seven user-set custom functions for film advance, DX coding, AF control, AE control and metering patterns. Other features include multi-exposure capability and a depth-of-field check button. TTL Flash AE options are the same for the 630 as with the 620.

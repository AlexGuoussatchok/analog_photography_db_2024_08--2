Intended to replace the EOS 630, the Elan has many of the features found on its higher-priced contemporaries, yet was priced to fit snugly between the 1 Os and the Rebel XS. It was the first EOS to feature a unique film winding system called Whisper Drive. Instead of using the traditional gear train to advance the film, the Elan uses a belt drive, which goes a long way toward reducing winder noise.

Autofocus modes are single shot (focus priority) and AI Servo (predictive continuous autofocus). Manual focus is also available.

Exposure modes include program with shift, shutter-priority and aperture-priority AE, depth-of-field AE, and metered manual. The Elan also has die same four PIC (Program Image Control) modes found on the Rebel models and has the Bar Code program similar to that found on the 10s, but which can store up to five programs at a time (the 10s can store only one at a time). TTL flash AE is available with the built-in flash or dedicated accessory units. The built-in flash will zoom to adjust its coverage from 28mm to 80mm, and has a pre-flash red-eye-reduction system.

Metering modes include a six-zone evaluative mode, centerweighted averaging, and partial (the central 6.5% of the viewfinder). Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/4000, plus B, with flash sync at 1 /125.

Other features include the Quick Control dial found on the EOS-1, seven built-in Custom Functions (including depth-of-field preview, second-curtain flash sync and mirror lock-up), a self timer, DX film coding with override, automatic film rewind and mid-roll rewind.

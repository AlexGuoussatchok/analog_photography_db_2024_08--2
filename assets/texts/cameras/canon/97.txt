The Rebel G is the most recent version of Canon’s ever-popular Rebel series. While earlier models were available both with and without a built-in flash, the Rebel G is only available with the flash. In this way, and given the fact that it looks almost identical to the Rebel XS, it appears to be more of an update to the Rebel XS, rather than a totally new design. An examination of the two cameras will bear this out, since many of the features are unchanged (Canon’s PIC modes, shutter speeds, etc.).’

New for the Rebel G are the following: when using the Speedlite 220EX or 380EX, the Rebel G now incorporates the same E-TTL flash automation found on the Elan II; the 3-point AF system is the same as is found in the Elan II; the user can choose which of the 3 AF points to use; auto exposure bracketing is available in fi stop increments up to ± 2 stops. A feature called “Night Scene” has also been included, which is used to bias TTL flash photos toward longer shutter speeds - usefi.il in situations, for example, where one might wish to freeze a foreground subject against a twilight sky. Canon has also developed a new mirrorcoating technology that increases the light transmission within the Rebel’s roof-type prism to the point that it rivals a traditional pentaprism in brightness.

Improvements on the Rebel G include a redesigned meter display for the manual mode, a partial-metering and AE lock button that will “remember” its setting for up to four seconds, allowing sufficient time for recomposition before
taking the shot (previous versions required the button to be depressed during exposure), a red-eye reduction override system, where, if the photographer suddenly needs to “capture the moment,” the camera will not force the user to wait for its output to take effect, and an in-focus alarm that may be activated or deactivated in all operating modes (the alarm could be activated or deactivated only in specific modes on previous models).

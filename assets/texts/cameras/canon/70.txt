EOS 620

Despite its age, the EOS 620 still remains somewhat popular on the used market because of its top flash sync speed: 1/250 second. The only other EOS cameras with this flash sync speed are the professional models.

Available autofocus modes are one-shot (focus priority) or continuous (servo). Metering patterns include a six-zone evaluative pattern or partial area (6.5%). Exposure modes include a program mode with manual shift override, aperture and shutter-priority AE and metered manual. Additional exposure controls include auto-bracketing, multiexposure capability and a depth-of-field check button. Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/4000, plus B, with the above-mentioned X sync of 1/250 second.

Other features include interchangeable focusing screens, exposure compensation, DX coding with manual override, a self timer, TTL flash, auto fill-flash, second-curtain flash sync and multistrobe effects. The integral motor drive advances film at speeds up to 3 fps with auto film loading and rewind, and mid-roll film rewind.

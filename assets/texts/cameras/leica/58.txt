THE LEICAFLEX SL - INNOVATIVE AND TECHNICALLY

SUPERIOR

Fortunately, Leica quickly realised this, and in 1968 the Leicaflex SL appeared. This not only thoroughly remedied the main criticism of the earlier models, but did so in such an elegant and efficient way that the Leica regained a technical and innovative edge.

The TTL metering via a semi-silvered area and mirror attached to the main reflex mirror gave a spot reading in a position exactly equal to the film plane. It was the most precise system available. The new focussing screen, consisting of coarse microprisms in the inner area and very fine ones over the remainder, was an optical tour de force. It provided excellent focussing accuracy with incredible brightness, and it was to be many years before other manufacturers achieved anything comparable. Even by the most modern standards the SL screens are first-class, their only drawback being that sometimes a very slight colour cast is caused by the coatings used. However, this only becomes noticeable when comparing them with a more neutral, modern screen

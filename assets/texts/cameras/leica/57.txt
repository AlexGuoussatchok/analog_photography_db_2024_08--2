LEICAâ€™S FIRST REFLEX

The first Leicaflex was a superbly built camera but was already out of date when it appeared. It lacked through-the-lens (TTL) metering, already available on a number of less expensive competitors, and the focussing screen, with its clear, see-through outer area and ability to focus only in the central microprism spot, was unsatisfactory to most people.

THE MAGNIFICENT SL2

There were, however, some gaps in the lens range, and when the SL2 came along in 1974 not only were there some very worthwhile detail improvements (eg eight times greater meter sensitivity, display of f stops as well as shutter speeds in the viewfinder, hot shoe etc) but the body was slightly reshaped and the mirror box redesigned to accommodate three new lenses (16mm fisheye, 24mm wide-angle and an 80-200mm zoom). These were based on Minolta optical designs but were re-engineered by Leica with quality control to Leica standards.

The SL2 was a magnificent camera, possibly the finest ‘mechanical’ SLR ever built, with a meter sensitivity that is still better than most current SLRs. Second-hand examples in good condition are highly sought-after and correspondingly expensive. The SL2 was only in production for a very short time, however, as once again Leica was fighting hard to keep pace with new developments.

On the technical front, reliable electronically controlled shutters combined with aperture-priority automatic exposure systems were already proving very successful, as evidenced by the Pentax ES launched in 1971. SLRs were becoming steadily more compact, the market leader in this respect being the Olympus OM1 of 1972. Competitors’ production costs were cut sharply as camera manufacturing techniques were revolutionised with increasing use of plastics, microchips and ever more automated production lines. Canon set the pace with its AE1, and selling prices came down dramatically.

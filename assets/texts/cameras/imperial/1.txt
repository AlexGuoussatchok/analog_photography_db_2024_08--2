The Imperial Instant Load 900 is a simple viewfinder camera manufactured by the Imperial Camera Corporation of Chicago. When it debuted in 1963, the 900 was one of the first cameras designed to be used with Kodak’s 126 film cartridge which had been introduced just earlier that year.

Like the vast majority of 126 cameras, the Instant Load 900 was aimed at the low-end consumer market and therefore only has simple controls. Its fixed-focus, fixed aperture lens is mated to a shutter with only one speed (1/80) which is controlled via the shutter button located on the front of the camera opposite the viewfinder window. There’s a thumb wheel on the top plate that which advances the film and also rotates the flash cube socket. The 900 has no tripod socket and its bottom plate is bare with the exception of a green film door release button.

I picked up this Imperial Instant Load 900 for $0.99 at a local charity shop after a year-long thrift store camera drought. The camera is in very good condition despite being over 50 years old and is quite handsome as far as 126 cameras go. Plus, it was made right here in Chicago which puts a smile on my face whenever I think about it.

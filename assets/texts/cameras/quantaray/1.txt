Quantaray D2-RZ
Quantaray D2-RZ

　The Kantaray Delta 2-RZ, an OEM model, was produced by Tokyo Kogaku based on the RM300 at the request of an American camera supplies trading company called Riz. If you look closely, the design of the warship section is different from the RM300, and is almost the same as the Carena. In particular, it is noticeable that the design of the apex of the prism, which used to have an acute angle, has become slightly flattened, and the index point for setting the shutter speed dial protrudes from the side of the prism cover, but this was changed in later tests. It is clear that this design was also adopted in the AM-1 of the work, and it is also common to the SIMCO LS-1 that inherited it.
　The lenses are also under the Quantaray name, and the Topcon name has been thoroughly removed, but the fact that the letters "TP" are included in front of the serial number gives a sense of the fact that it is a Topcon product, albeit slightly. Even so, even the name of the winder has been changed thoroughly, but this model is the only one where the brand of the winder has been changed, and the font color is also green.

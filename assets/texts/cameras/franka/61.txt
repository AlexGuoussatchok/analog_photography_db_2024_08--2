A mystery: This 35 mm camera of unknown origin has the melodious name Franka, which would indicate that it came from Bayreuth. But the device is far too young for that (probably from the 90s) and too modern (motor, electric flash, red housing, CdS light meter). According to the label, the (glass) lenses come from Japan. Lens: 1:3.5/35mm Other features: "Film Drive" display, counter, rewind button, carrying strap. Who has an idea? According to an email from a website visitor, a company Hartec Wilson dc had the camera on offer from 1992 to 1994 and sold it to various dealers: "The distributor was a Stockholm company, which had previously purchased this camera from Germany." There are said to be 2,400 copies still lying dormant in various warehouses... Interesting!
